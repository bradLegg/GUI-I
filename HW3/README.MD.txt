     I had a lot of trouble with the assignment.
     Though the assignment seemed simple, I could
     not figure out how the positioning was done.
     The majority of my trouble came up when I wanted
     to put the navigation bar to the left of the
     content div without using HTML to assist.

     I think the source of my difficulty was misuse
     of the wrapper div, though I have run out of time.
